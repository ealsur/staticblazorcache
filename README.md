# Blazor Starter Application

This template contains an example [Blazor WebAssembly](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/blazor/?view=aspnetcore-3.1#blazor-webassembly) client application, a C# [Azure Functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview) and a C# class library with shared code.

## Getting Started

Create a repository from the [GitHub template](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.22/user/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) and then clone it locally to your machine.

Once you clone the project, open the solution in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and follow these steps:

- In the **API** folder, copy `local.settings.example.json` to `local.settings.json`
- Press **F5** to launch both the client application and the Functions API app

_Note: If you're using the Azure Functions CLI tools, refer to [the documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local?tabs=windows%2Ccsharp%2Cbash) on how to enable CORS._

## Template Structure

- **Client**: The Blazor WebAssembly sample application
- **API**: A C# Azure Functions API, which the Blazor application will call
- **Shared**: A C# class library with a shared data model between the Blazor and Functions application
